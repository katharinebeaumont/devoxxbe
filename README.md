## Part I

1. Read the PDF in this repo. This gives you some background on the Q Learning algorithm.

2. Make sure you have Java 8 installed. You will also need the [ant build tool](http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html)

3. Go to [QMaze](https://github.com/katharinebeaumont/QMaze), and follow instructions there.

## Part II
